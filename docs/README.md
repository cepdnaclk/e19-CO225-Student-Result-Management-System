## Introduction

 The absence of a student results management system in a university can lead to several real-world problems:
1. Data disorganization and difficulty in retrieving information.
2. Inefficient workflow and increased administrative workload.
3. Lack of transparency for students to access their results.
4. Challenges in analyzing and reporting student performance.
5. Limited support for decision-making processes.
6. Security and privacy risks associated with manual handling of records.
   
Implementing a student results management system addresses these issues and brings efficiency, transparency, data organization, analytical capabilities, and improved security to the university.
