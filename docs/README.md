## Introduction

The absence of a student results management system in a university can lead to several real-world problems:
1. Data disorganization and difficulty in retrieving information.
2. Inefficient workflow and increased administrative workload.
3. Lack of transparency for students to access their results.
4. Challenges in analyzing and reporting student performance.
5. Limited support for decision-making processes.
6. Security and privacy risks associated with manual handling of records.
   
Implementing a student results management system addresses these issues and brings efficiency, transparency, data organization, analytical capabilities, and improved security to the university.

## Key Features

- **Admin**
   - Course Registration: The Admin role is responsible for registering courses within the system. They can enter course details such as course code, name, credits, and coordinator information.
   - Requesting Results: The Admin has the authority to request the relevant Course Coordinator to upload the final grades for a particular course. This is done by sending a request through the application, providing a relevant link.

- **Course Coordinator**
   - Uploading Results: Course Coordinators can easily upload final grades for their assigned courses through the application. They can input the grades or marks achieved by students, which become the official results. Any grades manually entered by students will be replaced by the Coordinator's results.
   - Inquiry Checking: Course Coordinators have access to a system feature that allows them to view and respond to inquiries or messages sent by students. This functionality enables them to provide clarification, guidance, or support regarding course-related matters or grades.

- **Student**
   - Result Entry: Students can manually enter their total final confirmed marks or grades through the application for courses where the results haven't been uploaded by the Course Coordinator. These marks will be saved, but students cannot see other students' grades.
   - GPA Calculation: Students can calculate their current GPA using the system. The application can also calculate the necessary grades for each semester to achieve an expected GPA in upcoming semesters when the user enters the desired GPA.
   - Continuous Assessment Support: When continuous assessment marks (quizzes, assignments, projects) are entered for a particular course, students can get calculated required exam marks for the expected grade of that course. This helps them track their progress and understand what is needed to achieve their desired grades.
   - Rank Display: The system shows the rank of the student within their batch and field based on the confirmed marks entered. This feature allows students to gauge their performance relative to their peers.
