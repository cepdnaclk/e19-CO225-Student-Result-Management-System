Undergraduate Student Marks Management System
---------------------------------------------------------

The Undergraduate Student Marks Management and Analysis System is designed to facilitate the management and analysis of undergraduate students' marks. The system primarily targets undergraduate students themselves, allowing them to track their academic performance, calculate GPA, and set goals for future semesters. The system also provides functionality for batch administrators and field administrators to register courses and manage the uploading of final grades.

Key Features
------------

1. Course Registration: Batch administrators and field administrators can register courses by providing details such as course code, name, credits, and coordinator information.

2. Grade Upload Request: Administrators can send a request to the relevant course coordinator to upload the final grades for a course. The coordinator can upload the grades without the need to login or sign up to the system, although they have the option to do so.

3. Results Management: If the coordinator uploads the results for a course, students will not be able to edit those results further (results in closed state). Any manually entered results by students will be replaced by the coordinator's results. If the coordinator hasn't uploaded the results, students can enter their total final confirmed marks or grades through the application (results in open state).

4. GPA Calculation: Students can calculate their current GPA using the system. The system keeps track of the marks entered for each course and calculates the GPA based on the corresponding credit hours.

5. Expected GPA Calculation: The system can calculate the necessary grades for each semester to achieve an expected GPA. When the user enters their desired GPA, the system analyzes the previous marks and suggests the required grades for upcoming semesters.

6. Exam Marks Calculation: For courses with continuous assessment components (quizzes, assignments, projects), students can calculate the required exam marks to achieve their expected grade in the course. The system takes into account the confirmed marks entered for continuous assessment and computes the minimum required exam marks to achieve the desired overall grade.

7. Rank Display: Based on the confirmed marks entered by students, the system provides the rank of each student within their batch and field.


Conclusion
-----------

The Undergraduate Student Marks Management and Analysis System provides a comprehensive solution for managing and analysing undergraduate students' marks. It empowers students to track their academic progress, calculate GPA, set goals, and make informed decisions about their education. The system also streamlines the process of uploading final grades and ensures accuracy and transparency in the evaluation process.
