Undergraduate Student Marks Management System
---------------------------------------------------------

  The Undergraduate Student Marks Management and Analysis System is designed to facilitate the management and analysis of undergraduate students' marks. The system primarily targets undergraduate students themselves, allowing them to track their academic performance, calculate GPA, and set goals for future semesters. The system also provides functionality for batch administrators and field administrators to register courses and manage the uploading of final grades.

The absence of a student results management system in a university can lead to several real-world problems:

1. Data disorganization and difficulty in retrieving information.
2. Inefficient workflow and increased administrative workload.
3. Lack of transparency for students to access their results.
4. Challenges in analyzing and reporting student performance.
5. Limited support for decision-making processes.
6. Security and privacy risks associated with manual handling of records.

   Therefore this system includes easy course registration, seamless uploading of final grades by course coordinators, and student input for courses without uploaded results. The app calculates necessary grades for upcoming semesters and offers a ranking system based on student performance within their batch and field.

Key Features
------------

1. Course Registration: Batch administrators and field administrators can register courses by providing details such as course code, name, credits, and coordinator information.

2. Grade Upload Request: Administrators can send a request to the relevant course coordinator to upload the final grades for a course. The coordinator can upload the grades without the need to login or sign up to the system, although they have the option to do so.

3. Results Management: If the coordinator uploads the results for a course, students will not be able to edit those results further (results in closed state). Any manually entered results by students will be replaced by the coordinator's results. If the coordinator hasn't uploaded the results, students can enter their total final confirmed marks or grades through the application (results in open state).

4. GPA Calculation: Students can calculate their current GPA using the system. The system keeps track of the marks entered for each course and calculates the GPA based on the corresponding credit hours.

5. Expected GPA Calculation: The system can calculate the necessary grades for each semester to achieve an expected GPA. When the user enters their desired GPA, the system analyzes the previous marks and suggests the required grades for upcoming semesters.

6. Exam Marks Calculation: For courses with continuous assessment components (quizzes, assignments, projects), students can calculate the required exam marks to achieve their expected grade in the course. The system takes into account the confirmed marks entered for continuous assessment and computes the minimum required exam marks to achieve the desired overall grade.

7. Rank Display: Based on the confirmed marks entered by students, the system provides the rank of each student within their batch and field.

Team Work
-----------
As team of 8 people, we were able to divide the app into two parts to complete the requirements. The activities done by each teams are provided below:

Group 13 : Managed to complete the student side app implementation, where there is a signup and login page and there is a userinterface for the student to get the grades, to calculate the expected GPA, to see the personal details, to insert some additional details if wanted and to add the finalized grades.

Group 15 : Managed to complete the administrator and course coordinator side app implementations, where the administrator will register for courses, can request from the course grades from the course coordinator and also he/she can view their personal details. Next, the course cooridinator can upload the results, also can view their details. Moreover, there is an inquiry page to request about important events.

Conclusion
-----------

  The Undergraduate Student Marks Management and Analysis System offers a comprehensive solution for the management and analysis of undergraduate students' marks. It enables students to effectively monitor their academic progress, calculate their GPA, establish goals, and make informed decisions regarding their education. Additionally, the system simplifies the procedure for uploading final grades, ensuring precision and transparency in the evaluation process.
